# 👋 Hi, I'm Chloe (S2chloeS2)

I'm a developer with a full stack in design,  
currently studying Computer Science at **Columbia University**.

🛠️ I build web applications using **React** and **Python**,  
with a focus on clean code, intuitive UX, and real-world usability.

Before transitioning into tech, I spent over 5 years as a fashion and graphic designer —  
a background that helps me create user-friendly and visually compelling interfaces.
